# Target Practice Trading

This application was created using Javascript, React, MongoDB, Express, JSX/HTML and CSS3.

Created by Jack, Matt, Stephanie and Kevin :)

## Project Brief

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of cryptocurrencies that she wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. 

She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP 

The local trader should be able to:

- View total current value.
- View individual and total performance trends.
- Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
- View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

## Target Practice Trading

Our application breaks down the cryptocurrencies that the local trader has invested in and shows the current market value of their investment in US dollars.

## Advanced Functionality

We are going to add the option for users to play a game where:

- They have a fixed amount of money to invest in cryptocurrencies
- Their portfolio goes up and down over time according to the market
- They can sell their investments at any time and re-invest in other cryptocurrencies
