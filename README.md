# Target_Practice_Trading

This application was created using Javascript, React, MongoDB, Express, JSX/HTML and CSS3.

Created by Jack, Matt, Stephanie and Kevin :)

## Project Brief

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of cryptocurrencies that she wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. 

She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.



## Target Practice Trading

Our application breaks down the cryptocurrencies that the local trader has invested in and shows the current market value of their investment in US dollars.
